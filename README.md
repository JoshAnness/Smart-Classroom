## Smart-Clock
At our school, we have a huge problem with our clocks. Our clocks don't tell the right time... But we decided to fix this by implementing our Smart Clock. The Smart Clock not only displays the right time but also displays important messages from administrators and teachers alike. The clock not only facilitates time and announcements, but keeps students safe.
## Digital Sign In/Out
Our school has a variety of sign in and sign out methods. Some teachers require a verbal confirmation and others do it with paper and pencil. We decided to make it easier on teachers and students and implemented a digital sign in/out website.
